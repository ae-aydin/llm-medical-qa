He was outside gardening when he suddenly lost vision in his right eye. He then immediately called emergency medical services, but by the time they arrived, the episode had resolved. Currently, he states that he feels fine. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. His current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and insulin. His temperature is 99.5\\u00b0F (37.5\\u00b0C), blood pressure is 140/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cardiac exam is notable for a systolic murmur along the right sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Pulmonary exam reveals mild bibasilar crackles. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with 5/5 strength and normal sensation in the upper and lower extremities. The patient has a negative Romberg's maneuver, and his gait is stable. A CT scan of the head demonstrates mild cerebral atrophy but no other findings.
